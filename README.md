# Snake Game
This is a simple Java program that implements the classic Snake game. The game consists of a snake that moves around a board and eats food to grow longer. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own body.

How to play

* To start the game, run the SnakeGame.java file.

* Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.

* Try to eat as much food as possible without hitting the wall or yourself.

* The game will save your highest score in the snakeGameSave.txt file.

Features

* The game uses the SnakeBoard.java file to create and update the board, which is a 2D array of integers.

* The game uses the Snake.java file to create and manipulate the snake, which is a singly linked list of coordinates.

* The game uses the Coordinate.java file to store and compare the x and y values of each node in the snake.

* The game uses the FileUtils.java file to read and write the highest score from and to the snakeGameSave.txt file.

* The game uses the Prompt.java file to display messages and prompts to the user, such as the game over message and the restart option.
